# WEALTH HEALTH PROJECT

## General information

This project is the new version of Wealth Health Website.\
This version has been developed in React.js by **Fabien HUPEL** for **OpenClassrooms FrontEnd Degree.**\
The [previous website version used jQuery ](https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/P12_Front-end).\
In this project a jquery library for datatables is replaced by a component "Datatable" imported from another library (fhp-component-library) [developed and published in another project](https://github.com/fabhup/Fabienhupel_14_08102021_Component) to store Wealth Health React components.\
Redux is used in this project for state management.
